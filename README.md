## Smort.io Obsidian Plugin

This is an Obsidian plugin to import Smort.io articles in Markdown.

Open the command palette (using cmd+p on macOS for example) and type Smort. You should see `Smort: Get Smort.io article as Markdown`. Select that command and enter the smort.io share link. The markdown version of the article will be pasted!

Caveats

-   Highlights will be in a single color
-   If the highlight in Smort covers stylized sections (bold, italicized, blockquote etc), then it will be split into multiple highlights in the markdown.
